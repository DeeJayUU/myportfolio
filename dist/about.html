          <p>
            I am a graduate with a degree in BSc(Hons) Computer Security from the University of Wolverhampton. My experience is made up of a life surrounded by software/technology and  my time at university. 
            I hope to find and progress within a successful company.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am fascinated by the evolution of technology in our daily lives; I have a keen interest in futuristic technology and like to keep myself up to date on political/technological world news. 
            My areas of interest are: cyber security, ethical hacking, privacy, web development, programming, software development/engineering, latest hardware advancements, procuring computer hardware, the effects of social media and technology on society, 
            changes to relevant government legislation.

          <h6>Life time around technology</h6>
          <p>
            At an early age I was exposed to computing when my father and I built a computer together, since then I have been obsessed with all things tech from 
            the latest PC hardware to games and gaming consoles <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            Since then my interests have matured and are now more in line with what I mentioned above:<br /> Cyber Security, programming, ethical hacking and 
            the effects of technology and social media on society. Although I still like to go back and enjoy my simpler interests by enjoying the odd video game here and there.
